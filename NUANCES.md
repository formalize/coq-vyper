# Semantical Nuances

## Count Loops

In the original Vyper language, the loop doing something _n_ times looks like this:

		for i in range(start, start + n):
			do_stuff()

Here *range* can be thought of as expanding to a list:

		range(start, start + n) = [start, start + 1, ..., start + n - 1]

Instead, our dialect introduces *count* function with the correct semantics for doing an iteration _n_ times:

		count(start, n) = [start, start + 1, ..., start + (n - 1)]

The only difference here is the extra parentheses which would not matter if addition was associative. But Vyper arithmetic is not associative because of overflow checks. So this loop fails due to the overflow check:

		max_uint: uint256 = ~0
		for i in range(max_uint, max_uint + 1):
			do_stuff()

whereas this one works:

		for i in count(~0, 1):
			do_stuff()

Of course, the inability to finish loops at exactly 2<sup>256</sup> â€“ 1 is not an everyday problem. Yet for a verified compiler no problem is too small. Together with the weird and irregular grammar of the *range(var, var + ...)* construct, this is the reason for introducing the *count* loop.

## Augmented Assignment

There are two possible ways to interpret _a += f()_ and our dialect follows the Python way:

	old_a = a
	increment = f()
	a = old_a + increment
	
For comparison, here's the C way:

	increment = f()
	a = a + increment
	
The difference is observable if _f()_ changes _a_.


## Multiple Representations of Integers

The semantics of _uint256_ is defined without requiring only one representation for the same value modulo 2<sup>256</sup>. The default implementation uses big integers for uint256, so for example the integers 2<sup>256</sup> and 0 both represent the uint256 value of 0.

This does not affect the semantics of the language because there's no way to obtain and no way to detect the integers outside of the 0..2<sup>256</sup> range by using the basic operators. However, that could be possible with custom built-in functions.

There's one (fortunately, only one) resulting quirk in the compiler: it is unable to to replace _x ** 1_ with _x_. The reason is, _x ** 1_ is the canonical representation of _x_ and therefore is not identical to _x_, but merely indistinguishable from _x_ by normal means. But the compiled code must produce an identical result.


## Zero Values for Missing Storage Variables

What should happen if we try to access a storage variable but it's just not there? It might seem natural to raise an error. But a better way is to just silently assume the variable to be 0. The reason is that any built-in function could, at least in principle, unexpectedly remove the variable from the storage, and the effort required to ensure this does not happen is simply not worth it.
